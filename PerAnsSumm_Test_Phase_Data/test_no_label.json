            "A doc diagnosed me with dust mite allergy 6 months ago and it was a slow uphill battle ever since. Medication: For over the counter medication, Claritin was great. For major attacks, my doctor gave me Zyrtec. He also gave me this ointment, Maxitrol, which helps reduce the swelling since I'd have huge welts on my face from it. Zyrtec and Claritin are not as powerful in knocking you out as Benadryl although they still do have a bit of making you a little bit drowsy or dull.  Pillow and mattress casings worked wonders for me. So did changing bedsheets and pillow cases every 5-7 days. Dust mites love moisture so it's important to keep everything dry. Some fabrics are also more prone to dust mite infestation than others.  Someone told me that Bounce fabric softener sheets placed inside pillows and bedsheets work. I tried it. It made my bed smell good and I didn't have any attack... although I don't know if it was because of Bounce or not. I didn't notice any change when I used Febreeze either."

            "If you ask me, I would say this issue could benefit by having Louise Hay's work and philosophy applied to it.  Here's what she might say: Stuffy Nose can be a result of not recognizing self worth The right side represents masculine and the left, feminine. Without knowing you, I would think that you are down on yourself lately - perhaps dwelling upon hurtful words by someone important in your life (of the sex that corresponds to your problem). Louise Hay would suggest that every time you have a negative thought about yourself, you stop and say (out loud or in your mind) I recognize my own self worth and I love and appreciate myself.  That kind of thing can work in just a couple days if you do it dilligently. I, personally, would also recommend essential oil steam treatment - it just worked a treat on my kids.  Close the drain and sit on the edge of the bath tub while the shower runs super hot with a few drops of essential oil in the tub.  I think Tea Tree works the best, but you can also use Eucalyptus or peppermint - anything cleansing and activating.  You can also just poor boiling water in to a big bowl or pan with a the essential and put a towel over your head and the bowl and breath in the steam. I also recommend a vapor rub - but I hate Vicks VapoRub - I use the Johnson & Johnson baby brand.  I rub it on the sinus area on the face from nose toward the ear and put a bit on the chest and the tip of the nose to help clear out.  Using these tools I had my non-nose blowing kids sorted out in just 3 days. Peace!",
            "If it was allergies both sides of your nose would be involved and you would have sneezing and possibly some clear nasal drainage.  Since you don't mention that it is probably sinuses.  You can try taking Sudafed to see if this helps.  Not sure how long you have had this as you only stated \"stuffy nose for a while now\" but if it is bad or continues you may want to get it checked out.",

If it can, then it is most likely a candida (yeast) infection.  Any condition in which your immune system drops (such as prolonged used of antibiotics, corticosteriods, or immunocompromising diseases like AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.) can predispose you to this infection. This infection can also cause redness of the tongue without the white coat.  If it is oral candidiasis, also called oral thrush, then antifungal treatment can be prescribed to you by a doctor. Now if the white stuff can not be easily scraped off, then the diagnosis is most likely something called leukoplakia that could be precancerous.  Either way, see a doctor.

We use All Free and Clear (I think that is the name) for our laundry and Bounce dryer sheets that have no fragrance.  Downy also makes a free and clear liquid fabric softener. For bathtime, use either Cetaphil Cleanser or the generic version of it from Walmart is the Equate version.  Moisturize after bath with Cetaphil Moisturizing CREAM (not lotion, but cream that comes in a jar).  If is really bad you can also use Aquaphor Healing Ointment.  This is greasy and will stain clothes but works wonderfully.

Trichuriasis is common worldwide (in particular among countries with warm, humid climates) and primarily affects children, who may become infected if they ingest soil contaminated with whipworm eggs. The ingested eggs hatch, and the whipworm embeds in the wall of the large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum). The main risk factor for infection is ingestion of eggs from soil contaminated with feces. Some outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (due to presumed soil contamination). The development of symptoms depends on the burden of worms/eggs.

Take her in.",

It is just taking its time coming in. If you are still worried you can go to a doctor. Possibly your daughter was born without a replacment tooth. But not to worry. If she seems sad just tell her that her teeth went on a long vacation but they couldn't take her with them. Wish you and your child the best."

Is there any advantage or disadvantage to this method for sculpting, as compared to three sets of 12 reps with the same pound dumbells?",

            "Your pyramid training protocol is effective. Someone else posted a different one and that is good too. In fact I know of several other types of pyramids that are also good. If you want definition you need to cut fat though. Try high intensity interval training. It should let you cut fat without any muscle loss. In fact you can still build. Keep in mind you should always change your training protocol every so often. For example you could cycle between pyramids, max-ot and German volume training. You would get nice results from that. In addition, here is my favorite pyramid protocol. I do the same number of reps. I start with 2 or 3 warm up sets getting heavier. Then I do my heavy set where I max out and go to failure at my chosen rep range. Then I lower the weight a little on each aditional set. The advantage is you can max out heavy when you are fresh and continue to get more sets in with less rest.",
            "Actually you should do 3 sets 12,10,8 or 10,8,6 reps starting with a weight that gives you enough resistance, then try to increase the weight from 3 to 5 pounds each hand each set. This method is one of 2 methods used in weight training. This one method is good for muscle fatigue training and is best also for sculpting your body, the other method would be to increase your muscle strength and does not sculpt your body as well but will actually increase your over all strength. Using the heaviest weight for 3 sets of 12 reps. I suggest you to get barbells over dumbbells (difference is that with barbells you can change the weight plates while dumbbells are fixed weights,and as there name suggest you cannot change there weight) they are a better investment.

This evening was my first physical exercise other then casual walking in about 2 years.  Right away when I was jogging my shins began to hurt.  Why is this?  Is it my shoes, my weight?  or just my lack of exercise? and What can I do to reduce and/or be rid of this pain?",
        "answers": [
            "It could be a combination of all the things you mention.  Pain in the shins while exercising, commonly referred to as shin splints, is a condition where there is pain in the anterior tibia caused by overuse of the anterior tibilias muscle. They are most common in inexperienced runners or runners who overtrain. The pain is usually worsened by exertion and other factors: - Running on hard surfaces - Insufficient padding in the shoes  - Over-pronated and/or flat feet can also lead to increased stress on the lower leg muscles during exercise - High arched feet can experience shin splint discomfort because this foot type is a poor shock absorber. The treatment for shin splints is rest. Running and other strenuous lower limb activities should be avoided until the pain subsides and is no longer elicited by activity. In conjunction with rest, icing and anti-inflammatories may be suggested by a doctor or trainer, though there is some controversy over their effectiveness. A contributing cause of shin splints in some cases is the relative weakness of the muscles on the anterior of the lower leg compared to those in the calf. In this case exercises that preferentially strengthen the anterior muscles may help alleviate or avoid shin splints. If you are just starting to run.  Take it easy and progress into a walking program first before running.

        "answers": [
            "Treatment Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary valve stenosis, and few or no symptoms, do not require treatment. In more severe cases, the blocked valve will be opened surgically, either through balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valvulotomy. For initial treatment, balloon valvuloplasty is the procedure of choice. This is a catherization procedure in which a special catheter containing a deflated balloon is inserted in a blood vessel and threaded up into the heart. The catheter is positioned in the narrowed heart valve and the balloon is inflated to stretch the valve open. In some cases, surgical valvulotomy may be necessary. This is open heart surgery performed with a heart-lung machine. The valve is opened with an incision and in some cases, hypertrophied muscle in the right ventricle is removed. Rarely does the pulmonary valve need to be replaced. Alternative treatment Pulmonary valve stenosis can be life threatening and always requires a physician's care. In mild to moderate cases of pulmonary valve stenosis, general lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications, exercise, and stress reduction, can contribute to maintaining optimal wellness. Prognosis Patients with the most severe form of pulmonary valve stenosis may die in infancy. The prognosis for children with more severe stenosis who undergo balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valvulotomy is favorable. Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis can lead a normal life, but they require regular medical care. finally i wish the lil baby all health :)  if you have any specific question my e-mail drlioness2000@yahoo.com",
            "I was diagnosed with pulmonary valve stenosis at around the age of your daughter.  I am now 22 years old.  Around the time of my diagnosis the doctors did many tests and I had several cardiac catherizations.  The doctors found out from all of these tests that my pulmonic valve was so tight and was about to close (I had severe pulmonic stenosis; some is not severe therefore surgery would not be required probably).  The doctors performed open heart surgery when I was 3.  They totally removed my pulmonic valve.  This is the only valve that you can live without for a period of time.  The valve usually has to be put back at some point because without a valve there is some leakage to the right side of the heart.  For me, it will be within a year or so.  Some are much earlier when they have to have it replaced and some are later.  It all depends on the individual.  One huge recommendation is to go to a highly ranked hospital even for the tests.  Hope this helps!",

            "Heart failure has several basic etiologies.   1)  Ischemic - blockages in the arteries causing changes in the heart muscle. 2)  Valvular - leakage in one or two valves making the heart output inefficient.  There can also be leaks between the right side and the left side of the heart (called a shunt) that can affect the heart's efficiency too. 3)  Chemical toxicity - certain treatments, like chemo used to irradicate breast cancer can be toxic to the myocardium. 4) Post myocardial infarction - heart attack causes damage that may never fully heal.   5)  Idiopathic - No known other cause.  There's the genes and it usually is with people who have no other risk factors and it can happen at a young age.  Sometimes you hear about young athletes suddenly dying with this as a complicating issue. Treatments as discussed above can be very helpful. People can live very long lives with heart failure, but truly the prognosis depends on the etiology of the problem.  If the problem can be fixed or improved then the prognosis naturally improves.   Go along with your Mom (if she's okay with it) to her appointment and talk all of this over with her medical provider.  Good luck."

            "My initial advice:  Take your medicine regularly.  If the particular medicine/inhaler doesn't work well for you, work with your asthma/allergy specialist to see what would work better for you.   If you don't have a specialist, I recommend one, as they usually are up on all the developments in this field.  Takes measures to prevent reactions.   Maybe take your inhaler as a preventative about a half an hour before you participate in active sports.  I do this, myself.  I have had asthma most of my life.  When I was 13, treatment for asthma wasn't as good as it is now, at least for me.   The medications now seem to have fewer side effects than what they insisted I should take for long-term daily treatment when I was younger.   Because the side effects were awful, I refused to take it around age 13, and even with my inhaler, it was not under control.  As a result, I couldn't be very active as a teen.   I gained a lot of weight, too, because when it wasn't under control, I couldn't exercise, and sometimes put me on steroids so that I could actually breathe - and those made me put on weight in a hurry.    Now, as an adult who consistently takes medication that works for me, things are a whole lot better.   I take daily asthma meds as well as daily med for allergies (I have several, and they mess with my asthma - which makes it hard to exercise outside sometime), along with my \"emergency\" inhaler, which the goal of all the other meds is to keep the use of this inhaler to a bare minimum.   As a teen, I used my emergency inhaler so often - I went through one every 2 -3 weeks - that it became not very effective on me any more.  Because I don't use it so often (usually just before exercise), it is much more effective for me. My body is no longer \"addicted\" to it."

            "The human intestine is a necessary part of the digestive system. The human digestive system consists of the mouth, the throat (pharynx), the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine. Specifically, the human intestine consists of two parts, the small intestine and the large intestine. The small intestine is a long, narrow, coiled tube extending from the stomach to the large intestine. This is the place where most digestion and absorption of food takes place. The small intestine of a human can be as long as six to eight meters long, depending on age and size of being. So much length can be compacted into so little space because of the nature of the small intestine; it is coiled and takes up less space, while maintaining it's enormous surface area. The large intestine is the posterior or end of the human intestine that consists of four regions the, the cecum, the colon, the rectum and the anal canal. The large intestine is wider but shorter than the small intestine. It measures approximately 1.5 meters in length and its primary function is to absorb water and electrolytes that have already passed unabsorbed through the small intestine. In mathematics, as well as physics, the value of the whole is equal to the sum of its parts. Therefore the average length of the human intestine is equal to the length of the small intestine added to the length of the large intestine. As a result the average length of the human intestine can be anywhere from 6 to 8.5 meters in length depending on size and age of the person it occupies."

An Oxygen level of 88% on room air is when oxygen is prescribed for a person, and this is to keep the oxygen level greater than 92%. The reccommendation by your friend's doctor is probably a good one. Most people with COPD are given scripts for nebulized treatments 3-4 times a day and as needed for shortness of breath.",

            "at a rate of 91% on room air you need to be started on lo oxygen via nasal canula or non rebreather mask start the flow at 1 or 2 on the delivery dial dont go much higher as the lungs are now responding to the carbon dioxide levels not the oxygen levels. yes it is smart to have an o2 saturation meter",
            "You have to be very safe when putting a COPD patient on oxygen due to the fact that they breath off there hypoxic drive. It is normal for COPD patients to have lower O2 sats. because they retain so much carbon dioxide. A 90 02 sat is not that bad for a COPD patient, if it drops any lower a nasal cannula may be feasible. But it would have to be a low flow rate. If his o2 sat is being monitored by a pulse ox, you may want to have an arterial blood gas performed because spo2(pulse ox) is not 100% correct. Spo2 is an estimate of oxygenation status. Readings below 90 on a pulse ox will not be accurate",
            "To answer your question directly, saturation of 90% is not considered dangerous and in fact it may be desirable.  Oxygen management of patients with COPD is complex and can be dangerous if left to inexperienced hands.  On one hand, oxygen supplementation has been shown to prolong life of the COPD patients.  On the other hand, too much oxygen may actually cause death via the mechanism described above.  The bottom line, discuss all changes of oxygenation rate with your friend's doctor and be clear on what changes are allowed. That is very important."

If this is what you are talking about, then yes, you are eligible for the shot. The federal government recently recommended the vaccinations for HPV for girls as young as 9. You can get the shot at your doctor's office. If he or she doesn't have it on hand, they can tell you who does. Alternately, you can ask your parent or guardian to take you to a gynecologist, who should be able to give you the shot. The link between HPV and cervical cancer has only been discovered recently, and it is estimated that most women will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. Even though you are not having sexual relations now (at least I hope not!) chances are good that you can get it later on. The vaccine is recommended for all women, not just women with a history of female reproductive cancers, so I don't know that you need to be absolutely sure about your birth-family history. I, too, am adopted, and I have had a hard time finding any medical information at all. What that means is that I have to be extra careful about things that tend to run in families, like breast cancer. I am 38, so I just try to be very vigilant about those kinds of things, and I have regular exams, mammograms, etc.  Right now, there is no need to be worried. Simply talk to your parent or guardian, and tell them you would like the shot. You don't have to show proof that it was a problem for your birth-mother, as they do them now as a preventative measure. I know what it's like to worry about things and not have a way to find out if they might be in your genetic makeup. It's very difficult to get medical information most of the time, so just take responsibility for your own health as you get older, and make sure you are screened for everything. If you want to contact me, you can do it through this site, and I will be happy to talk to you about this, as long as your parent or guardian agrees and does not mind. Be well."

It's just a habbit. I decided one day to quit and it was a little difficult at first. Not because I still wanted to bite my nails but because I would do it and be completly unaware for a minute or two. It helps to have the people you spend the most time with know that your trying to quit....mainly because they can bust you when your start to nibble. If you have been a nail biter for a long time then you are probably used to using the actual tip of your finger but beyond that the skin on your fingertip isn't used to being hidden from air by your nail,it's an odd feeling but it goes away in a few weeks. Here is my advice to you. keep under your nails very clean of crud of all types, it really helps to just not touch them till they have to be cut. Even if you still want them unnaturally short and never plan to grow them out, cut them when they bug you. You are used to playing with your hands, do something else with them. Get an emory board and make the edges smooth and instead of biting your nails trace them with thumb. I actually bought a ring and whenever I wanted to bite my nails I would twirl the ring around my finger. It sounds silly and it might be something else that helps you quit but thats what worked for me and I never felt the urge to bite again. It really is a dirty habbit and I guess I was always a little embaresed about having it anyway. You'll be happy that you quit if you decide to and you will probably wonder why you ever started to begin with.",

If you are a female and have color blindness, and your husband has no family history of the disease then it's like a 2/3 chance for the boy and still no chance for the girl, but if both of you have a family history for the disease then a girl could get it.  This is because a boy only has one X sex chromsome so if they got the recessive trait of colorblindness on that X chromosome then they wouldn't be able to get a dominant gene, unlike females who have two X sex chromosomes, and thus have a bettter chance of recieving a dominant gene to mask the color blindness recessive gene.",

If they carrier one X chromosome with the trait and the other X carries nothing, then she is a carrier and she CAN pass that on to her son, if she has one. She'd wouldn't however be able to pass that on to her daughter though unless she was colorblind (two infected X's) or she carried it (one infected X) and her husband was colorblind (one infected X).

        "context": "my daughter has really bad eczema, and the dermatologist prescribed her topical steroids. i had several other doctors tell me that they wouldnt use steroids on a baby because of all the risks. i dont know who to trust/believe and i just wanted to get some more input on this.",

            "let me tell you this much... don't trust or believe the people on Y answers over your own Dr!!! get several opinions... see what the general answer is.. Then trust your gut and your heart I believe that maternal instinct is something that still exists and is very strong follow what you KNOW your baby needs... if you listen to the voice inside after you do some fact gathering you will have the right answer.",
            "Steroid crean thins out the skin so if she has ezema she will need it when she gets older.  So if you use it now God knows what her skin will look like.  My grandchildren both have it too.  Try Dove soap without the perfume.",
            "Being that the medication is topical... meaning it is only penetrating the top layer of skin I would say it is safe.. I used to work in dermatology and we treated many children with eczema and in majority of the cases a topical steroid was prescribed.. the only danger would be if the child puts the medication in his/her mouth...",
            "Trust ur instincts gurl it's ur baby they are talking about.Visit websites on health.    As far as I know,if it's really bad maybe the doc is prescribing a small doseage...which may not be that harmful.",

Pain can be involved in coltis, IBS, differticulosis and -itis, etc. Abdominal pain is not normal. If your physician will not see you till Tuesday, I recommend you visit an urgent care center or the emergency room. P.S. No one, not even a qualified physician can give a definitive diagnosis over the net, nor would that be ethical. Those symptoms need a physician examination before a definitive diagnosis.",

            "Oh, oh.  I know just what you have.  Kidney Stone.  It's probably caused some infection thus the mucos.  The pain is caused by the kidney stone's movement . . . you can hang in there til Tuesday, just take Advil for pain, drinks LOTS of water to see if you can pass it (altho it might be too large).  If the pain is severe, go to the ER for pain management and probably a CT Scan.  If you get a high fever I would go to ER before Tuesday.  Good Luck."

        "question": "No antibodies found after 5 months...is it conclusive that I do not have genital herpes?",
        "context": "The last time I had sex was in Jan. 2006 of this past year.  That has been a while.  I got tested for everything in the summer and that was about 5 months after the sexual exposure.  When I got tested the genital herpes blood test for active antibodies came back as negative.  I do not have it. BUT, my question is:  Can anti-bodies show up in the blood for genital herpes after 5 months?  After a year?  Or can I be pretty conclusive that I do not have genital herpes?    It has been 8 months since sex and I have never had an initial out break or sore, but from reading many sources a lot of them say some people will never have any symptoms or outbreaks and can still pass them on to someone.   I just do not want to transmit something that could be lurking around in me and I don't even know it.   Is a blood test conclusive or am I just walking blind until my next doctors appointment when they tell me \"yep, the anitbodies for genital herpes have finally showed up\"..  THANKS!!!",
        "answers": [
            "Why are you worried unless you have had sex with someone who has an active herpes outbreak? True, herpes can also be spread thru' someone who has no outbreaks. So the age old precaution applies......... always use condoms!!! It offers some sort of safety but not 100% against herpes. Instead of asking here you should go online and read more about herpes. You will learn alot and understand the desease better.",
            "I always thot once you get herpes, you always have it",
            "Unfortunately antibodies not found in the blood test is one thing, what they forgot to mention is that herpes simplex II cannot be confirmed unless there is an outbreak in tissue, and at that very moment an std test is taken, sorry.",
            "I think you're fine. If you're worried, get tested once or twice a year, just to make sure. Blood tests are very accurate. Why, do you expect to have genital herpes? did you see herpes soars on your partner? Maybe next time you have intercourse, make sure you have \"safe sex\" and if you think your partner could be infected with something then ask him/her to get tested. By the way there are worse disease out there than herpes, so it's a good idea for both you and who ever you're with to get tested regularly.",
            "Absolutely not.  The new thinking on herpes is that it is possible to become cured if you go long enough without and outbreak.  However, we are talking something in the order of 10 years without sign of the disease.  5 months?  pffft.  Means nothing.",
            "Did you have sex with somebody with Herpes? It sounds like it..If so, there is a very big chance that you have Herpes..It can stay in your body for a long time. I've read that Herpes actually sits in the base of your spine and in your nervous system. You should wait and see if you have an outbreak. Until then, STOP HAVING SEX. But keep in mind that CONDOMS DO NOT FULLY PROTECT YOU FROM HERPES since its caught from skin-to-skin contact.  Take this whole experinece a warning of what can happen to you when you have Unprotected Sex. I hope you dont have it, and I hope you've learned your lesson young lady."
