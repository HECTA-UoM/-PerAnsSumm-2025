    "question": "What is the percentage that a parent with color blindness will pass it down 2 their kids?",
    "context": "Im researhing on color blindness.",
    "answers": [
      "I actually just learned about this in Biology class.  If you are a male with color blindness, and and you wife doesn't have any family history of it, then if you have a girl there is no chance of it, but if you have a boy there is a 50/50 chance.  If you are a female and have color blindness, and your husband has no family history of the disease then it's like a 2/3 chance for the boy and still no chance for the girl, but if both of you have a family history for the disease then a girl could get it.  This is because a boy only has one X sex chromsome so if they got the recessive trait of colorblindness on that X chromosome then they wouldn't be able to get a dominant gene, unlike females who have two X sex chromosomes, and thus have a bettter chance of recieving a dominant gene to mask the color blindness recessive gene.",
      "Color blindness is transmitted by female parent and the male child suffers.Female child can transmit(not suffer)to her son.It is a sex linked disease.Rare exceptions occur if mother is a carrier and father is a patient.",
      "Colorblindness is a sex-linked trait. That means it affects men more then woman because it attaches to the X chromosome. Since woman have two X chromosomes (XX) they need both of their genes to carry the gene in order to have colorblindness. For a man, his genes are XY, and since he only has one X, it only takes one X carrier to make him colorblind. Woman can also be carriers of colorblindness. If they carrier one X chromosome with the trait and the other X carries nothing, then she is a carrier and she CAN pass that on to her son, if she has one. She'd wouldn't however be able to pass that on to her daughter though unless she was colorblind (two infected X's) or she carried it (one infected X) and her husband was colorblind (one infected X). Then the daughter would receive the infected X from her mother and the infected X from her father, making her colorblind. You need to find out if the husband IS colorblind and if the wife IS colorblind or could be a carrier to find out if the child would be colorblind.",
      "it's hereditery you have to lnow the genes of the parents first",
      "i would say that the chances are there, but i don't think they are very high. i had a neighbor who was color blind, but his two kids were not; i myself am slightly color blind, but neither of my parents were. as far as i know, there has not been a history of it in my family either.",
      "Mother colorblind + Father normal  = Boy 100% on colorblindness + Girl 100% carrier Mother + Father colorblind = Boy + Girl 100% on colorblindness Mother carrier + Father colorblind = Boy 50% on colorblindness + girl 50% carrier Mother + Father normal = 0% on colorblindness for girl + boy Mother normal + Father colorblind = Boy normal + girl 100% carrier Mother + Father colorblind = both girl + boy 100% on colorblindness"

    "question": "how to eliminate protein in urine?",
    "context": "ok ok i know that protein in urine can be caused by a kidney infection or high blood pressure and whatnot. is there anything i can do to avoid getting tested positive? perhaps drink more water?",
    "answers": [
      "Why would this even be a problem, unless you're on a low-protein diet?",
      "why would this be a concern as opposed to correcting the condition that caused it?  If youre spilling protein its going to continue until that condition is corrected.",
      "Protein in urine can be a possible sign of diabetes as well. You should definately be tested for it. Dark colored urine that is high in proteins can be a sign of dehydration. Depending on the color. Certain vitamins such as vitamin b can cause bright yellow urine. Drinking water will help if it caused by dehydration, and can help to flush your system of kindney stones.  Also having protein in your urine wont make you test positive for drugs or anything. But drinking more water isnt going to fix the problem if it is caused by an underlying medical condition. If if is caused by kindney problems or diabetes it needs to be treated.",
      "Proteinuria may be a sign of renal (kidney) damage. Since serum proteins are readily reabsorbed from urine, the presence of excess protein indicates either an insufficiency of absorption or impaired filtration. Diabetics usually suffer from damaged nephrons and develop proteinuria. Consult a Nephrologist. Please see the webpages for more details on Proteinuria.",
      "I just got out of the hospital and the doctors told me that I had protein spilling out in my urine...the only thing that they have told me so far is to stick with soups, chicken and rice.  I dont think that the doctor told me why it was spillin in my urine, but he also told me that I had a problem with my gut and I might have Lime Disease."

      "let me tell you this much... don't trust or believe the people on Y answers over your own Dr!!! get several opinions... see what the general answer is.. Then trust your gut and your heart I believe that maternal instinct is something that still exists and is very strong follow what you KNOW your baby needs... if you listen to the voice inside after you do some fact gathering you will have the right answer.",
      "Steroid crean thins out the skin so if she has ezema she will need it when she gets older.  So if you use it now God knows what her skin will look like.  My grandchildren both have it too.  Try Dove soap without the perfume.",
      "Being that the medication is topical... meaning it is only penetrating the top layer of skin I would say it is safe.. I used to work in dermatology and we treated many children with eczema and in majority of the cases a topical steroid was prescribed.. the only danger would be if the child puts the medication in his/her mouth...",
      "Trust ur instincts gurl it's ur baby they are talking about.Visit websites on health.    As far as I know,if it's really bad maybe the doc is prescribing a small doseage...which may not be that harmful.",

If your physician will not see you till Tuesday, I recommend you visit an urgent care center or the emergency room. P.S. No one, not even a qualified physician can give a definitive diagnosis over the net, nor would that be ethical. Those symptoms need a physician examination before a definitive diagnosis.",

      "Oh, oh.  I know just what you have.  Kidney Stone.  It's probably caused some infection thus the mucos.  The pain is caused by the kidney stone's movement . . . you can hang in there til Tuesday, just take Advil for pain, drinks LOTS of water to see if you can pass it (altho it might be too large).  If the pain is severe, go to the ER for pain management and probably a CT Scan.  If you get a high fever I would go to ER before Tuesday.  Good Luck."

    "question": "No antibodies found after 5 months...is it conclusive that I do not have genital herpes?",
    "context": "The last time I had sex was in Jan. 2006 of this past year.  That has been a while.  I got tested for everything in the summer and that was about 5 months after the sexual exposure.  When I got tested the genital herpes blood test for active antibodies came back as negative.  I do not have it. BUT, my question is:  Can anti-bodies show up in the blood for genital herpes after 5 months?  After a year?  Or can I be pretty conclusive that I do not have genital herpes?    It has been 8 months since sex and I have never had an initial out break or sore, but from reading many sources a lot of them say some people will never have any symptoms or outbreaks and can still pass them on to someone.   I just do not want to transmit something that could be lurking around in me and I don't even know it.   Is a blood test conclusive or am I just walking blind until my next doctors appointment when they tell me \"yep, the anitbodies for genital herpes have finally showed up\"..  THANKS!!!",
    "answers": [
      "Why are you worried unless you have had sex with someone who has an active herpes outbreak? True, herpes can also be spread thru' someone who has no outbreaks. So the age old precaution applies......... always use condoms!!! It offers some sort of safety but not 100% against herpes. Instead of asking here you should go online and read more about herpes. You will learn alot and understand the desease better.",
      "I always thot once you get herpes, you always have it",
      "Unfortunately antibodies not found in the blood test is one thing, what they forgot to mention is that herpes simplex II cannot be confirmed unless there is an outbreak in tissue, and at that very moment an std test is taken, sorry.",
      "I think you're fine. If you're worried, get tested once or twice a year, just to make sure. Blood tests are very accurate. Why, do you expect to have genital herpes? did you see herpes soars on your partner? Maybe next time you have intercourse, make sure you have \"safe sex\" and if you think your partner could be infected with something then ask him/her to get tested. By the way there are worse disease out there than herpes, so it's a good idea for both you and who ever you're with to get tested regularly.",
      "Absolutely not.  The new thinking on herpes is that it is possible to become cured if you go long enough without and outbreak.  However, we are talking something in the order of 10 years without sign of the disease.  5 months?  pffft.  Means nothing.",
      "Did you have sex with somebody with Herpes? It sounds like it..If so, there is a very big chance that you have Herpes..It can stay in your body for a long time. I've read that Herpes actually sits in the base of your spine and in your nervous system. You should wait and see if you have an outbreak. Until then, STOP HAVING SEX. But keep in mind that CONDOMS DO NOT FULLY PROTECT YOU FROM HERPES since its caught from skin-to-skin contact.  Take this whole experinece a warning of what can happen to you when you have Unprotected Sex. I hope you dont have it, and I hope you've learned your lesson young lady."
