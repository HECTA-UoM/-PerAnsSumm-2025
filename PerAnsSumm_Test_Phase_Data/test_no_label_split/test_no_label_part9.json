    "question": "Had a big red whitehead on my pubic area. itpopped, now swollen and bleeds a lot, occasionally. what is it?",
    "context": "The bump started off as a redish scar-like mark but never grew or itched.  It remained for 2-3 months until recently it swole a little after showering and then it popped.  Now the whole area around it has become redish, it hurts to apply pressure and will bleed quite a bit every now and then.  White Stuff came out (like a pore/pimple) when It first popped and then again the next day and that is when it started bleeding a lot.  They do not look like herpes blisters.  In other words, the pimple is not clear, nor are there any clusters of blisters.  Instead, it is one pimple like white head. I have gotten 3 or 4 of these in the past but this one has been the worst.  They have all appeared in the same general area of the pubic region (all within 1.5 inches of one another).  I understand that only a physician can and should diagnose the issue, but I would certainly like some feedback on what this thing could be.  Thanks for the help.",

      "It sounds like you had a boil.  They can be caused from an in-grown hair.  The hot water from your shower probably brought it \"to a head\" and that is why it popped.  I get these frequently and really don't know why or how to prevent them.  Just keep it as clean as possible and let it drain.  I have occasionally had to have them lanced by a doctor. Hope this helps.",
      "sounds like a boil . or ingrown hair in my opion . but go to your.dr. and let hm chech this out better safe thAN SORRY?",
      "most likely it is a boil. do you shave down there? I get in grown hair sometimes that get infected and puss up",
      "it could be genitale herpes. Or it could be a cyst. Its cause by and ingrown hair. My sister had one in her arm pit and she thought it was cancer but it turned out to be a cyst!!!",
      "You didn't say whether the problem is on your external pubic area or on your labia (internal or external).  Actually, you didn't even specify if you were male or female, but I'm assuming female. :) If the problem is on an outside area normally covered with pubic hair, it is probably a boil.  Boils are a bad infection of a hair follicle, and people prone to them can get them repeatedly.   If the problem is on your labia, internal or external, then it may be a Bartholin's cyst.  Although they hurt and can swell, they are not serious per se.  Women can also get these repeatedly.   As you said, a yahoo forum is no substitute for medical examination, but those are the most likely diagnosises."

      "right now I am not sure there is anything anyone can do enough of, every illness now people run to the doctors and usually leave with medication. Schools now say if a child misses 1 day you have to take them to the doctors for a doctors note and most of the time medication. If our systems are getting messed up now what will it be like when they are grown? I have 2 kids a 14 year old son and a 7 year old daughter and I try and help my kids at home. I have medical training so I know not to let them get to sick but what is wrong with a hot tea with lemon and honey for a sore throat? Or a hot steamie bathroom for a chest cold? I actually had some other parents tell me how awful I was because I mention to someone else that I would in a heart beat have my daughter around another kid who has chichen pox, why not? She is still very young and the younger the better. I think it is better for the body to get the antibodies naturally than a shot. It is sad to think about it but I beleive at some point in the furture, maybe far far away from now but at some point we will not have medication to save us.",
      "Resistant strains are caused when Antibiotics are used when they should not be. If you have cold or flu symptoms, these are viral and antibiotics should not be use.

    "question": "why cant i stop biting my nails? I know its gross,but why cant I stop?",
    "context": "Do I have a nerve problem,or is it just a gross habbit?",
    "answers": [
      "I started biting my nails when I was three and continued to do it for a little more then 2 decades. I can say that I was not a nervous person although strangers probably assumed I was. It's just a habbit. I decided one day to quit and it was a little difficult at first. Not because I still wanted to bite my nails but because I would do it and be completly unaware for a minute or two. It helps to have the people you spend the most time with know that your trying to quit....mainly because they can bust you when your start to nibble. If you have been a nail biter for a long time then you are probably used to using the actual tip of your finger but beyond that the skin on your fingertip isn't used to being hidden from air by your nail,it's an odd feeling but it goes away in a few weeks. Here is my advice to you. keep under your nails very clean of crud of all types, it really helps to just not touch them till they have to be cut. Even if you still want them unnaturally short and never plan to grow them out, cut them when they bug you. You are used to playing with your hands, do something else with them. Get an emory board and make the edges smooth and instead of biting your nails trace them with thumb. I actually bought a ring and whenever I wanted to bite my nails I would twirl the ring around my finger. It sounds silly and it might be something else that helps you quit but thats what worked for me and I never felt the urge to bite again. It really is a dirty habbit and I guess I was always a little embaresed about having it anyway. You'll be happy that you quit if you decide to and you will probably wonder why you ever started to begin with.",
      "I have the same problem...  I know i do it when I'm bored, nervous, or stressed out.  I've tried putting clear nail polish on my nails so whenever i go to bite it doesn't taste so pleasant.  So far it has worked and my nails are growing back again.",
      "You have an anxiety problem. I use to chew my nails so low they bled, till one day I yelled out real loud: STOP!!!!!!! I never bit my nails again! And stop feeling your nails to find the sharp spots to chew! You can do it, when you feel your hand coming up to your face, yell: STOP! and put your hand down. I only had to do this once, but if it doesn't work for you the first time, keep doing it,it WILL work!!!!! Just think, in a couple of months,you can show off your long healthy new nails!",
      "dont know why you can't stop.  but you can try to stop perhaps if you think of all the people that touch the things that you touch before you touch them. and how people could have just wiped their butts, picked their nose, picked up their dogs poo, had sex, scratched their butt, held their willie to pee, cleaned a litter box, grabbed some rotten food, took out the trash, or changed a tampon and didn't wash their hands and so after you touch what they just touched, you have all that nastiness on your hands and when you bite your nails, you are putting all those germs in your mouth.  hope that helps.  the gross factor made me quit biting instantly.  good luck.",
      "Probably it is a habit PLUS a thing you do when you are nervous  or uncomfortable or bored.  Try making notes about how you feel (before, during, after) biting your nails.  See if there is a pattern.   And try substituting something else -like chewing gum.   Good luck."

    "question": "Has anyone had surgery to remove a ganglion cyst on his or her hand?",
    "context": "Did you need physical therapy? Was there any scarring? Did the cyst come back?",
    "answers": [
      "Ganglion cysts usually only require surgery under certain conditions and usually you do not need physical therapy to recover.  These used to be called Bible cysts because the way people used to treat them was by hitting them with the largest book in the house and many years ago this was usually the Bible.  I absolutely do NOT recommend that you try this unless you really want to know the true meaning of pain.  Ganglion cysts also are treated by drainage via syringe but most physicians will only do this if you are having complications due to the cyst as they do have a high rate of reoccurrence.  It is thought that ganglion cysts are just pocketed areas of extracellular fluid that is being caught in between laters of connective tissue.  It is allowed to get into these areas because the inner most of outer most layer may have thinned or degenerated due to repetitive stress as many people that develop these cysts perform manual labor or work on computers all day but you may also have one for no apparent reason at all.  It is somewhat rare to have surgery for these but none-the-less people have it done every day.  And yes, more than likely it will come back in some shape, form or fashion.",
      "My daughter has one that comes and goes on her hand. Our doctor said you can have it lanced and the fluid removed ,but it might come back. I really don't think it is anything to worry about. If you do have it taken off I doubt if it would leave a very big scar. I'm sure your doctor can tell you.",
      "I didn't have surgery, but I did have a ganglion cyst.  My Dr. told that it still could come back even after surgery.  So the pain and recovery from the surgery wouldn't be worth it unless the pain was very bad.  So he told me that I should quite my job as a secretary (it was from typing) and it would probably go away.  It did go away on it's own after about a month.  It will occasionaly come back if I use it for typing, so I try to type only with my other hand.  When it does come back, it doesn't last long.",
      "ok i didnt have this surgery but a close family member did no for phyiscal therapy and yes it leaves a scar and hers did come back",
      "Sometimes that smacking with a book really works, but not always.  I had one once.  Just bumped it real hard accidently and it went away.  Really!",
