    "question": "I have allergies specificaly dust mites what can I do?",
    "context": "I can't see the little SOBs ,like invisible to the naked eye .Clean the hell out of my apartment with a aray of things no luck rash from them ..Is there a certain medicine I can take anyone else have this problem?",
    "answers": [
      "Go buy some Fabree Allergen spray at Food Lion or any store that carries it.     It eliminates 75% of dust mites. Use germ-x (handcleaner) on your mattress. Dust mites hate alcohol or babyoil products. Dont use around electric appliances.     Take a bath in olive oil and rash will go away.",
      "get rid of carpets, and all sorts of fabrics around the house, use blinds instead of drapes, dont wear fuzzy sweaters, have your air ducting cleaned, get an electrostatic air cleaner  put on your forced air heat system or a very good air filtration fan with filters you change often, clean like mad, use hypoallergenic mattress and pillow covers and make sure you dont use feather pillows. use leather , vinyl or micro fiber furniture. use any allergy pills like benedryl. have tile or wood floors,",
      "One tip--Buy a new pillow and wash the bed sheets once a week.  A plastice cover for the bed will greatly reduce the dust mites at night time(sleeping.)",
      "A doc diagnosed me with dust mite allergy 6 months ago and it was a slow uphill battle ever since. Medication: For over the counter medication, Claritin was great. For major attacks, my doctor gave me Zyrtec. He also gave me this ointment, Maxitrol, which helps reduce the swelling since I'd have huge welts on my face from it. Zyrtec and Claritin are not as powerful in knocking you out as Benadryl although they still do have a bit of making you a little bit drowsy or dull.  Pillow and mattress casings worked wonders for me. So did changing bedsheets and pillow cases every 5-7 days. Dust mites love moisture so it's important to keep everything dry. Some fabrics are also more prone to dust mite infestation than others.  Someone told me that Bounce fabric softener sheets placed inside pillows and bedsheets work. I tried it. It made my bed smell good and I didn't have any attack... although I don't know if it was because of Bounce or not. I didn't notice any change when I used Febreeze either."

    "question": "Stuffy Nose?",
    "context": "for a while now, theres always one side of my nose thats stuffy, and its really annoying and uncomfortable. i think its allergies but i dont know, and my nose keeps on irritating me, for example i sniff a lot, and i think it has something to do with the stuffy side. please help :D",
    "answers": [
      "If you ask me, I would say this issue could benefit by having Louise Hay's work and philosophy applied to it.  Here's what she might say: Stuffy Nose can be a result of not recognizing self worth The right side represents masculine and the left, feminine. Without knowing you, I would think that you are down on yourself lately - perhaps dwelling upon hurtful words by someone important in your life (of the sex that corresponds to your problem). Louise Hay would suggest that every time you have a negative thought about yourself, you stop and say (out loud or in your mind) I recognize my own self worth and I love and appreciate myself.  That kind of thing can work in just a couple days if you do it dilligently. I, personally, would also recommend essential oil steam treatment - it just worked a treat on my kids.  Close the drain and sit on the edge of the bath tub while the shower runs super hot with a few drops of essential oil in the tub.  I think Tea Tree works the best, but you can also use Eucalyptus or peppermint - anything cleansing and activating.  You can also just poor boiling water in to a big bowl or pan with a the essential and put a towel over your head and the bowl and breath in the steam. I also recommend a vapor rub - but I hate Vicks VapoRub - I use the Johnson & Johnson baby brand.  I rub it on the sinus area on the face from nose toward the ear and put a bit on the chest and the tip of the nose to help clear out.  Using these tools I had my non-nose blowing kids sorted out in just 3 days. Peace!",
      "If it was allergies both sides of your nose would be involved and you would have sneezing and possibly some clear nasal drainage.  Since you don't mention that it is probably sinuses.  You can try taking Sudafed to see if this helps.  Not sure how long you have had this as you only stated \"stuffy nose for a while now\" but if it is bad or continues you may want to get it checked out.",
      "This will sound gross and seem crazy but get a neti pot and use saline to rinse your your sinuses every night when you feel like this.  I do and it has had amazing results. You can get one at some drug stores or a whole foods or life grocer."

    "question": "forming a soft waxy or soft plasticky appearing solid in throat?",
    "context": "For about 6 months now I have begun forming a soft waxy or soft plasticky appearing solid mass of gunk that eventually will drop out of my eustation tube into my mouth/throat (I think, from the physiological drawings I have seen that this is where it is coming from). Prior to it dropping into my mouth I will begin feeling, with my tongue, a rough area on the side of my throat (behind my back teeth). It feels like I am getting a sore throat but am not really ill at all. I can touch the area with my finger and it feels unsmooth. Eventually, after about 5 days this thing will dislodge itself and fall into my mouth. The first couple times it just went down my throat and was a surprise. Since then I have been aware of what is going on and have acutally retrieved the thing to have a look at it. Should I be concerned about this thing? I haven't gone to see the doctor because I don't feel ill and haven't a really good explanation of what this is.",
    "answers": [
      "Possibly a tonsil infection...see a doctor",
      "that doesn't sound pleasant.  You might have a pocket of some sort that gathers gunk and then it just comes out.  I would go to an ear, eye, nose and throat doctor if I were you.  It could get to where it infects and causes trouble or blockage.",
      "Okay, this is going to sound disgusting, but does it look like a ball of pasta? Does it have a bad odor?  I'm not sure how old you are but I too had a period where this was happening to me all the time. It still occurs every now and then (during allergy season primarily) but not with the frequency it once did. It's been said that it is a build up of plaque (the same that covers your teeth) that accumulates. Just keep up with the oral hygiene.  It will pass. It's freaky, but it won't hurt you."

    "question": "Migraine: What is the cure? How do I get rid of it? Any specific medication or remedy?",
    "context": "I have been suffering from migraine since I was 13 years old. Back then, the migraine had been constant but did not last long and it was easy to cure with plain paracetamol.  Over the years, the migraine lessened but seem to last longer than it had been before and I have also grown immune to paracetamol thus, changed my medication to ponstan.  When ponstan stopped having effects on my migraine, a local pharmacist prescribed me with a different medication which later on lead me to the hospital because I was allergic to it.  Now, the migraine attacks are less frequent but very excrutiating everytime it strikes. My family doctor prescribed me with cafergot initially and it worked well until it too had stopped having effect on the migraine.  I have had enough with prescriptions and medications and was wondering if there is a way to get rid of it. For your info, my migraine is associated with symptoms like bleeding mucus, seeing stars and nasal pain.",
    "answers": [
      "There are two drugs out there, topamax which you would take every day, and relpax which you would take when you get the migraine.  I took relpax a few times and each time i got terrible chest pains that shot down my arm and i would fall asleep. once i woke up my headache was gone.  My neurologist is going to put me on topamax in 2 weeks for my daily headaches, so i don't know a lot about the side effects.  the doctor did mention that a significant side effect is weight loss...so now, of course, i can't wait to start taking it!  For now though, take some advil and drink something with a lot of caffeine in it, preferably coffee and lie down.  I was amazed that this actually worked. Feel better!",
      "I suffer also.  I don't know if there is a cure but it is a try this and try that situation.  I've suffered since early elementary school.  But I have found that Excedrin for Migraines works really well for me.  When I have a full blown, kick \"a\" migraine I have to go to my doctor for a shot of demorol. I have a friend who uses imetrex (sp?) and she speaks highly of this medication.  Ask your doctor about these and see if they help. Lying in a dark, quiet room, cold compress over the eyes helps.  Believe me when I say I feel your pain, good luck.",

    "question": "Tongue diagnosis help?",
    "context": "My tongue has a quite thick white coating at the moment which I know to be because I am currently sick with a virus. However, on the mid-right (my right) side of the edge of my tongue, there is a circular patch that is quite a pronounced red, with no coating at all. It is about 1 centimetre in diameter. Is this telling me that there is a problem with the organ that area of my tongue represents? I am generally not in good wellbeing and tend to get this circular patch everytime I get sick. My acupuncturist use to tell me which organs were represented by each area but I've forgotten. What interests me most is why this patch doesnt have the white coating?",
    "answers": [
      "you should consult a physician...and gargle",
      "Mate you need to go see a Naturopath or Herbalist and get that diagnosis done properly. I would be reluctant to answer without seeing you. The fact that you are a sickly person would indicate problems and they need to be addressed sooner rather than later. An educated guess only would have me suggesting perhaps the liver and kidneys need attention as well as the digestive system and immune system. Circulation may need attention as well. A proper energy diagnosis will show where you are blocked. I have treated many clients like this and the good news is that in most cases time and persistence with the herbal formulations has lead to a full recovery of health. I can not comment on your case but I would be off to see your Naturopath today and getting on with it. Craig - Naturopath.",
      "Is it possible that your red spot is from scraping off the white coat?  If so, maybe you should see if you have Candidiasis.  IF you have a supressed immune system, this may predispose you to this condition.",
      "First off, you may want to go get this checked out by your doctor. First check and see if the white stuff on your tongue can easily be scraped off.  If it can, then it is most likely a candida (yeast) infection.  Any condition in which your immune system drops (such as prolonged used of antibiotics, corticosteriods, or immunocompromising diseases like AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.) can predispose you to this infection. This infection can also cause redness of the tongue without the white coat.  If it is oral candidiasis, also called oral thrush, then antifungal treatment can be prescribed to you by a doctor. Now if the white stuff can not be easily scraped off, then the diagnosis is most likely something called leukoplakia that could be precancerous.  Either way, see a doctor.  You will know what to do if/when this happens again."
