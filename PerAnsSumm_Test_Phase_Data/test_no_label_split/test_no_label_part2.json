    "question": "does acidophilus treat eczema in children?",
    "context": "i've read that they've found that acidophilus is showing promise in treating eczema in babies. has anyone tried this? what doses were used?",
    "answers": [
      "Renew skin lotion from Melaluca cleared my sons Eczema up in 4 days. Amazed the doctors we had a follow up appointment on the 4th day and they were impresed.",
      "In my experience, no.  And, actually what I think you're talking about is a study that gave expectant mothers lactobacillus WHILE THEY WERE PREGNANT.  That DID work quite well, apparently.  But I'm not aware of any benefit associated w/ giving it to children after they're born. P.S.  Eczema is NOT a liver disorder.  :-)",
      "Most skin problems are because of liver toxins.  Look for a homepath that helps cleanes the liver is a good place to start.  Lavender on the skin will help topically.  I would look up an irodologist in your area or a good homepath practioner.  Ask at your local health food store or Chiroprator for suggestions.  Acidophilus is a good bacteria that we all need to help keep the bowels in good working order. There are acidophilus products for chidlren and also plain yogart with out sugars is good.  But before you give your child anything you really need someone that can muscle test to see what dosage for your baby.",
      "My children have eczema and the best thing you can do for your baby is to control the eczema rather than waiting for an outbreak to treat it.  To control it you must not use fragrance on anything that comes in contact with the skin.  This means that anyone who will be holding your child needs to do the same.  We use All Free and Clear (I think that is the name) for our laundry and Bounce dryer sheets that have no fragrance.  Downy also makes a free and clear liquid fabric softener. For bathtime, use either Cetaphil Cleanser or the generic version of it from Walmart is the Equate version.  Moisturize after bath with Cetaphil Moisturizing CREAM (not lotion, but cream that comes in a jar).  If is really bad you can also use Aquaphor Healing Ointment.  This is greasy and will stain clothes but works wonderfully.  You may have to see a dermatologist for a prescription for a mild steroid cream and possibly an antibiotic if it becomes open and infected. We have been dealing with eczema for 7 years now and you would never know my kids have it."

    "question": "My friend has a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.Problem no insurance,srs no help, ssd no med. plan for 2 yrs.?",
    "context": "Where do you go for help when you have ovarian ca. & no insurance, srs no help,ssd won't for 6 more months? Please I need answers my friend may die before someone helps her.",
    "answers": [
      "Call every University affiliated oncology center and find out if she can be entered in a research protocol. These are usually without any charge to the patient. You can even try a google search for keywords such as \"enrollment research ovarian cancer trial\".  One of the trials you should look into can be found at www.assist-ovarian.com  Good luck and god bless you both.",
      "There are clinics and hospitals out there that will help her even if you do not have insurance. They will bill you but you can pay it out however much you can afford ata  time, even if its only $5.00 a month as long as you pay them something.  Also there may be some kind of assistance throught the state in which you live in that can help her out with the bills!  Go to your local Deptartment of Human Services and ask them for help, more than likely in her situation there's something they can do to help.  Start with taking her to a clinic or hospital, make sure to ask the doctor to point you in the right direction as in what happens next.  People arent going to just turn her away and let her die!",
      "Has her oncologist said shes terminal ? or is it curable?? If shes terminal, she SHOULD be able to get SSI immediately, I did. And if shes too sick to go to them, they will do it over the phone. There are research clinical trials she may be able to get in also that would not cost her, but the important thing is to get her help ASAP! Most if not all hospitals have a fund set aside for patients who can not afford hospital bills, cant think of the name of it tho.. anyway, my aunt who is a nurse told me to go to the billing office and tell them I could not pay for my treatment (this was before i got the SSI) , and they could not turn a person down.. you have to sign a paper claiming pauper status, or did at that time. Check with her hospital and see if they have it, they will not offer it thats for sure but have to answer if they have such a program in thier hospital! Good luck and hopefully she will be getting treatment soon! OHHHH does she or can she get Welfare, such as food stamps? Some states will give you a medical card along with the food stamps if you are sick, so that might be an option also."

    "question": "Whats happens when you start, stop and start Chemo?",
    "context": "My boyfriend has a Brain Tumor,  he went thru chemo for 6  months.  Two months later he was told the Tumor is growing again ... He started Chemo last month, but has now been denied by OHP ... Until we can get some kind of insurance he can't continue the Chemo..  Does anyone know if this will make it worse or can he start back up after only being on Chemo for one month and be okay ... He can't see the doctor either for lack of insurance at this time.",
    "answers": [
      "He should not worry about paying for treatemtns at this time and get what ever treatements he needs. I am a cancer survivor and had no money to pay any of my medical bills, but I got all my treatememts I needed and today I am cancer free. I know at my hospital they had a \"wrtie off program\" where they white so much of the bill that cannot be paid if you are going though something like your boyfirend is going though, ALso there is ACS, CancerCare, and the Patient Addvociate Foundation, and Lance Armstrong Foundtation that is out there to help people like your boyfriend, they helped me and they can help him. Most of these organizations can be ffound on the intrenet. Take Care and god bless! *)",
      "It will indeed make it worse. He should continue EVEN IF he has no funds. Worry about payment LATER. You can always budget it into payments of even as little as $5/month. I've done it, I know.",
      "There is no really way to know, it would depend on the chemo they type of brain tumor it is and all kinds of other things. Has the Dr. tried to contract the company that makes the chemo your boyfriend uses? Quite often if the Dr (or the Dr's staff) is willing to contact the company and say that this person is not able to pay for their treatment the company will offer it at a discounted rate. You might have to fill out paperwork. Also check into getting medicare/cade (can't remember which it is). In my area if you call up the disability office and file paperwork proving that your medical bills are over x% of your income your get this supplemental insurance that will pay for everything beyond x%. With how much chemo costs I think your boyfriend would qualify. He really should stay on the chemo- encourage him to call the Dr and tell the Dr the situation and explore options for him to stay on his treatment plan.",

    "question": "has anyone ever heard of an infection on the brain caused by trichuriasis?",
    "context": "my granda was first diagnosed with alzheimer's but further tests revieled she has an egg on her brain by those things? please explain if possible, she is another country so I don't have much info",
    "answers": [
      "Yes I have heard of it. It is a very rare thing, mostly due to the fact that Americans in general have good living conditions. The infection is from the bacteria that resides on the egg itself. The egg was probably laid through her ear while she slept, or if she is debilitated in some way, maybe even without her knowing it while awake. If you can get her back here it would be best for treatment. Some high grade antibiotics are certainly in order and maybe more invasive measures if the egg happens to survive the anti-body attack.",
      "Trichuiriasis is a human disease caused by a parasitic whipworm called Trichuris trichiura. It is normally characterised by abdominal painand diarrhea The parasote is primarily found in the tropics and sub-tropicswhere the climate is warm and moist. the eggs incubate in such soil conditions. Generally, clinically significant infections are not common in developed countries. But third world countries are another matter. The parasite eggs hatch in the small intestine  and usually takes up human residence in the large intestine. Eggs pass through it to the colon and then to faeces. The eggs incubate 2 to 3 weels in the soil, and are picked up and end up in people through ingestion. Unsanitary food handling and cleanliness aid transmission and infection. The patient is usually treated with the drug mebendazole 300 m.g. taken twice daily for 3 days. I would perscribe it for longer than tha for you grandfather. I am not sure if the medication crosses the blood brain barrier. If not there will be problems. A tropical medicine specialist, or parasitologist-M.D. should be consulted as soon as possible. This organiism is not the parasite that causes trichinosis. (a Trichina spp. pest). Doc. Dan.",

      "Trichuriasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection of the large intestine by a parasite whipworm (Trichuris trichiura). Trichuriasis is common worldwide (in particular among countries with warm, humid climates) and primarily affects children, who may become infected if they ingest soil contaminated with whipworm eggs. The ingested eggs hatch, and the whipworm embeds in the wall of the large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum). The main risk factor for infection is ingestion of eggs from soil contaminated with feces. Some outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (due to presumed soil contamination). The development of symptoms depends on the burden of worms/eggs. Light infestations may lead to few or no symptoms. Heavy infestations may result in bloody diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia and on occasion, rectal prolapse.

    "question": "getting tonsils removed?",
    "context": "i have huge tonsils that both nearly touch the uvula in the middle of my throat. im considering taking them out, but my cousin got hers removed, then she gained a lot of weight. ive heard of other people thats happened to as well. has that happened to anyone else? does it hurt a lot? how long is the procedure and how long will i be in the hospital?",
    "answers": [
      "Taking out your tonsils usually doesn't take too long.  It takes about 30 minutes.  It takes longer for the anesthesia to wear off then for the tonsills to come out.  The tonsils directly don't have anything to do with your weight however when they are big people tend to eat less.  So when they are removed they do eat more and can gain weight.  As long as you stick to what you are doing right now your weight shouldn't change.  Finally the surgery does hurt.  It's like haveing the worst sore throat however new techniques have been developed that can decrease this pain.  There is a procedure called cobelation (using a coblator) that in some cases produces virtually no pain.  The risks with this procedure are the same as any other procedure to remove the tonsil but the pain is alot less.  Anyways, you should get your tonsils removed especially if you snore or have apneic episoids when you sleep (pauses in your breathing).",
      "it does not  hurt a lot but it hurts. some people just get there tonsils remove and eat a lot more then they used to  all you do is get sick and puke for a day or two.",
      "not big deal, remove it, it help you in your sleep and help others to sleep well.",
      "Hey!  I've had my tonsils removed.  It wasn't that big of a deal, my weight remained the same as before and the pain was definitely tolerable.  I found that ice-cream and yogurt were good things to eat after the surgery.  I suggest doing it i'm a lot happier now that they are out.  Good Luck!"
