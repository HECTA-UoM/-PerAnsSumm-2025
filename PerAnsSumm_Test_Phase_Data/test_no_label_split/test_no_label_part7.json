    "answers": [
      "You live with it and learn to control it.  It does take hard work, but you already know the consequences of a lack of control, don't you.   Medication, some counselling, and a good dose of self-control are necessary.  You can do it, while remembering that the consequences of not doing so are invariably unpleasant, and that the responsibility for those consequences is yours alone.",
      "You can take medicines to help out but u will have the disorder for the rest of your life.",
      "Hey I am a researcher in the field of psychiatry.  It is not necessarily life long.  If you were diagnosed young (as in adolescence or childhood) I would reconsider the diagnosis.  The adolescent brain undergoes many changes making them behave more impulsively and more moody than a typical adult and this is normal.  Which it is especially common for children in unfortunate circumstances to be diagnosed.  Their diagnosis is often inappropriate and contextually insensitive.  Everyone circumstances are different and I cannot give you advise personally.  However if you have moved from stressful environment to a non-stressful environment or become an adult I would recosider the diagnosis with an open minded physican facilating the removal of the drugs.  If you respond to the removal of the drugs by being a bit off in sleep and energy and such this is normal and I would give it many months to have you return to a baseline.  Try practicing mediation and make sure you eat healthy.",
      "It is something you will have for the rest of your life. But some medications can help make things more even. You don't have to be always on a high or always low, or numb.",
      "Well yes and no.  I think that it is a life time thing, but with the right meds and regular counseling I think you can \"get over it\".  But have to keep up on the meds or you relaps quickly. So yes you can feel \"normal\" again and stay that way, but you have to stay on the meds to keep feeling \"normal\"",

    "question": "What to do?",
    "context": "For the past 2 years I've been really depressed emotionally,phycially, from family,relationship,and general life issues. Some of the things I've thought about doing could cause people to get hurt but that's not what I want. I continue to cover up all my problems to avoid stressing and worrying others. I've thought about seeing a phhyciatrist, think it's neccessary? I have 2 kids to live for but feel like giving up. I know what I need to do but once I'm on a good path with clear thoughts I get thrown off. I want or need a better job, any resources?",
    "answers": [
      "Contact your local mental health center.  They should be able to provide an evaluation, assessment and medications.  A doctor will prescribe meds, but not get at the root causes and conditions. consider getting a physical to check your thyroid.  Most of all, don't give up!",
      "I wish I could help you but at present I feel like you.What helps me a lot is the thought that nothing lasts for ever so soon or late everything will be over.And also try thinking that something good and unexpected can come up and you will start feeling better. If this helps,you're not the only one feeling like that. Best of good luck from Italy.",
      "We all reach a point in our lives when we need to think about what's right for ourselves. If you are feeling this way it sounds like you to do something for yourself. Seeing a therapist would probably be a great solution. If you can't bring yourself to do it for your self think about your children. They can tell when somethings not right. So seeing a therapist may help you, which in turn could help your children.   Also no matter what you do not give up. From your question I can see that you are an extremely caring person, otherwise you wouldn't worry about hurting others so much.  Thus you have so much to bring to our world.  Maybe you could even find a job helping others. I find that helping others is the most rewarding and satisfying job in the world. It makes me want to keep pushing forward even when I get blown off track.  I hope that you keep on going, and that you realize how important you are to our world.",
      "go see a psychiatrist or even your family doctor.",
      "Get some professional help NOW!!  Don't wait any longer.  There are places that will take smaller payments or none at all if you really need it as they are needs based.  Look in your phone book for anyplace that will help with fees based on what you make rather than just a flat fee but get help now.",
      "I have experienced the same depression symptoms and finally got on medication and it turned my life around. I fought getting help for years because of the stigma attached to getting mental or emotional help. I would go to a psychologist before a psychiatrist. Most psychologists can refer you to an MD if necessary for medication. You could also start with a family doctor. Your kids depend on you. Don't do anything crazy without getting help. Good luck to you!!!"

      "Don't worry too much about weather you got it or not, since it is fully treatable and curable with antibiotics.  Get seen by a doctor very soon, who can test for antibodies to see if you really have it or not, and if you do, he can prescribe antibiotics to cure you within a week or so.",
      "Gonorrhea, also known as \"the clap,\" is an extremely contagious sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is the second most reported infectious disease in the United States (after chlamydia), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The gonorrhea bacteria is spread through the body fluids associated with sexual activity. Transmission can occur during any kind of sexual contact â€“ vaginal, oral or anal. In women, the disease usually first infects the opening of the uterus (cervix) or the urethra, the tube just above the vagina that leads to the bladder. Symptoms may include some unusual vaginal discharge (possibly bloody) or pain while urinating. Most women experience no symptoms. Gonorrhea infection in the anal area may be caused by anal sex or movement of the bacteria from the genitals. Oral sex may cause gonorrhea of the throat.",

    "answers": [
      "Your body is expelling the mucous that was caused by the virus. The mucous is white blood cells that were made by your body to combat the effects of the influenza. You should no longer be contagious if what you said above is true. Go to work and get paid! (Unless of course you still have sick days left)!",
      "If you took the prescribed antibiotics as recommended you are no longer contagious.  If you are feeling tired still your body is telling you that you need to rest.  Stay home for another day and see how you are feeling tomorrow.  As for your mucous.  Call the doctor.  As I am thinking about it the antibiotic that you took if you had ever had it may not be working.",
