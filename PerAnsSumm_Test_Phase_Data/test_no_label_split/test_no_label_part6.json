Asking here is liable to give you all sorts of interesting data, but you need professional help to work out a diet that meets your special needs.",

Just make sure you take insulin for whatever you're eating according to the plan you made with your doctor.  But. there are things that make it easier. If you buy snack sized packages of chips/candies, carbohydrate counting is a lot easier. Also, use a scale/measuring cup for foods like rice. Rice is 15g of carb for every 1/3 of a cup. Most pasta (check the package) is about 15g per half cup. Mashed Potatos are about the same.  Also... since i've been diagnosed with diabetes, I've been drinking alot of water. it doesn't have any carbohydrates in it, rarely does the body harm, and can be great with ice and a little lemon or mint.",

      "- check www.diabetes.org (Amer Diab Assoc) for books - eat balanced diet watching carbohydrate intake - watch portion sizes and check nutrition labels - fruits are good for you but high in carbs; eat in moderation and watch portion sizes - some \"veggies\" are really \"starches\"  like potatoes, corn, peas, \"dry\" beans => high in carbs - eat a variety of foods (similar to 2nd one above) - eat breakfast - eat small meals"

I was at my trampoling class today, and normally I have my inhaler with me - but don't need it - but today I forgot it. And got really wheezy. My mother had to take me home early.

Are you using any maintenance medications to keep your asthma under control like an inhaled steroid? 2.  How many times a week do you use your rescue inhaler? 4.  Do you use a spacer? 5.  When you are having trouble do you tell someone or do you try to hide it/  DONT HIDE IT TELL SOMEONE!   6.  Most importantly have you seen your doctor recently about your asthma?  There should be no reason why your asthma is not under control.  If you use your rescue inhaler more than twice per week it means your asthma is out of control.  Inhaled medications, not smoking, and asthma education are key for you!  Congratulations for taking control at this age!",

I'm also an asthmatic, and it's always good to follow your Doctor's advice.",
      "My initial advice:  Take your medicine regularly.  If the particular medicine/inhaler doesn't work well for you, work with your asthma/allergy specialist to see what would work better for you.   If you don't have a specialist, I recommend one, as they usually are up on all the developments in this field.  Takes measures to prevent reactions.   Maybe take your inhaler as a preventative about a half an hour before you participate in active sports.  I do this, myself.  I have had asthma most of my life.  When I was 13, treatment for asthma wasn't as good as it is now, at least for me.   The medications now seem to have fewer side effects than what they insisted I should take for long-term daily treatment when I was younger.   Because the side effects were awful, I refused to take it around age 13, and even with my inhaler, it was not under control.  As a result, I couldn't be very active as a teen.   I gained a lot of weight, too, because when it wasn't under control, I couldn't exercise, and sometimes put me on steroids so that I could actually breathe - and those made me put on weight in a hurry.    Now, as an adult who consistently takes medication that works for me, things are a whole lot better.   I take daily asthma meds as well as daily med for allergies (I have several, and they mess with my asthma - which makes it hard to exercise outside sometime), along with my \"emergency\" inhaler, which the goal of all the other meds is to keep the use of this inhaler to a bare minimum.   As a teen, I used my emergency inhaler so often - I went through one every 2 -3 weeks - that it became not very effective on me any more.  Because I don't use it so often (usually just before exercise), it is much more effective for me. My body is no longer \"addicted\" to it."

    "context": "I had Bronchitis. I was having some problems with my breathing. i know its normal when you are sick with that, but even after all my symptoms went away, i still had that breathing probs. Not real big ones, it was more like breathing hard, or catching your breath after going up a real long flight of stairs. Went to see my doc and he game me Albuterol. Told me to take it as needed. How do i know when its needed?  When i am breathing real hard? I dont want to overdoes on this stuff.",
    "answers": [
      "I suggest to take it as soon as you notice that you have difficulty in breathing. Waiting for the condition to worsen before taking the inhaler will decrease the speed of the medication to take effect.",
      "I have asthma and I don't have it bad I only have problems when I am sick.  I find you should use it only when you have real trouble.  That is when you need to use your inhaler.  If you aren't having problems with breathing then don't use it.  Especially if you are worried.  It is just when you are having  difficulty breathing that  you should you use it.  It is just to make breathing easier.  Hope that this helps.",
      "Albuterol should be used when you are having breathing difficulty; it is the sort of inhaler that is used as a \"rescue\" inhaler for those who have asthma.  Generally, two puffs, about 15-30 seconds apart should be used.  Bronchitis can take a while to really clear up, so don't despair.  Drinking a lot of water or other clear liquids can really help.  If, after you've used up the inhaler, you're still having problems, check with your doctor or a specialist in respiratory problems to be evaluated for the possibility of asthma or allergies.",
      "When an asthma crisis is beginning and I start to breath hard, I use the inhaler 2-3 puffs, 3 times a day. Sometimes that's enough and I get better after a few days. If not, and I can't sleep because of the great effort I have to do to breath, and even feel like I want to throw up because of the lack of oxygen, I start using the inhaler every 15 minutes for 4-5 hours. Like that, I can control the crisis myself and don't have to go to the hospital. But I insist you give your doctor a call to make sure, because not all inhalers are the same and I've never used Albuterol. Also try the following exercises: When you inhale through your nose, try exhaling through your mouth all the air you took in, but really emptying your lungs as much as you can. Then do it again, just be careful you don't hyperventilate. Also, lie on you stomach and have someone give you some chops on your back during at least 5 minutes, so as to help the residual air in your lungs to come out.",
      "Not much danger of over-dosing with Albuterol. Use 2 puffs whenever you are short of breath. Beware of any \"wheezing\" sounds in the lungs; you may have asthma. Dona G."

      "If I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere between 7 - 9 metres long. In order to fit in the length of both the small and large intestines, coiling is a necessity. Otherwise, we'd be as tall as giraffes. Hope my answer helped c\",)",
      "The human intestine is a necessary part of the digestive system. The human digestive system consists of the mouth, the throat (pharynx), the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine. Specifically, the human intestine consists of two parts, the small intestine and the large intestine. The small intestine is a long, narrow, coiled tube extending from the stomach to the large intestine. This is the place where most digestion and absorption of food takes place. The small intestine of a human can be as long as six to eight meters long, depending on age and size of being. So much length can be compacted into so little space because of the nature of the small intestine; it is coiled and takes up less space, while maintaining it's enormous surface area. The large intestine is the posterior or end of the human intestine that consists of four regions the, the cecum, the colon, the rectum and the anal canal. The large intestine is wider but shorter than the small intestine. It measures approximately 1.5 meters in length and its primary function is to absorb water and electrolytes that have already passed unabsorbed through the small intestine. In mathematics, as well as physics, the value of the whole is equal to the sum of its parts. Therefore the average length of the human intestine is equal to the length of the small intestine added to the length of the large intestine. As a result the average length of the human intestine can be anywhere from 6 to 8.5 meters in length depending on size and age of the person it occupies."
