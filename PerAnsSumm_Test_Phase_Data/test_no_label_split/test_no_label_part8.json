    "question": "Why the difference on Size Bra method?",
    "context": "I have been surfing on websites looking how to find the right bra size.  The answers being ranging between 46A and 42E.  Why the difference and What's the best method?",
    "answers": [
      "You know, I was never properly happy until I was actually measured. Salespeople do that at say, Victoria Secret but I wasn't comfortable with that so I found a magazine article and am really comfortable in all my bras now. They said to get a measuring tape and measure around the peak of your breasts and then underneath your breasts. The measure of beneath is your chest size; 32, 34, 36, etc. When you subtract the peak size from your chest size, you'll get your cup size, 1=A 2=B 3=C and so forth.",
      "US bra sizings are based on two things- the measurement around the body at the chest, and the cup size.  Best to go to a lingere shop that does bra sizings and get fitted.",
      "I have found the closest to accurate is the method used on justmysize.com although it is not totally accurate even and the problem is that most bras are different.  You would think there would be some standardization but, really, there isn't. Although if you stick with one company then you can generally get pretty close after a couple of tries...&#92; Good luck my friend...",
      "a 46 would be for someone who is very big around the rib cage, and A means a small breast, a 42 is fairly large around the rib cage, and an E is a quite large breast. its all a matter of are you all ribcage and no breast or lots of breast as well as a good sized rib cage,"

    "question": "Should copd patient have an oxygen tester, what levels should oxygen be started? What is a safe oxygen level?",
    "context": "Sorry for asking 3 questions but it is 5 points.  Friend has copd. Oxygen level was running at 95-97.  Now is 90. Uses nebulizer at home was told she could use it more than just at night. I'm concerned this could be a damaging level.  My mom also had this disease her specialist did just the opposite started on oxygen first, 10 yrs. later started nebulizer. Everyone is different and this may have been protocol back then.",
    "answers": [
      "I was told to quit all medications and let nature take it's course. Right now I can't talk about it. I have to go call 911. 911 was busy so I'll try and chat for a minute. Oops, there is an ambulance across the street. I'm going to go try and catch a ride......Hope your friend gets better.....",
      "A personal hand held SpO2 device (oxygen tester) is a good investment for anyone with COPD or severe emphysema.  An Oxygen level of 88% on room air is when oxygen is prescribed for a person, and this is to keep the oxygen level greater than 92%. The reccommendation by your friend's doctor is probably a good one. Most people with COPD are given scripts for nebulized treatments 3-4 times a day and as needed for shortness of breath.",
      "yes it would probably be a good idea for your friend to have an o2 tester, after the o2 levels drop under 91 they go into the red , anything over 91 is good but the higher the number the better the levels.",
      "at a rate of 91% on room air you need to be started on lo oxygen via nasal canula or non rebreather mask start the flow at 1 or 2 on the delivery dial dont go much higher as the lungs are now responding to the carbon dioxide levels not the oxygen levels. yes it is smart to have an o2 saturation meter",
      "You have to be very safe when putting a COPD patient on oxygen due to the fact that they breath off there hypoxic drive. It is normal for COPD patients to have lower O2 sats. because they retain so much carbon dioxide. A 90 02 sat is not that bad for a COPD patient, if it drops any lower a nasal cannula may be feasible. But it would have to be a low flow rate. If his o2 sat is being monitored by a pulse ox, you may want to have an arterial blood gas performed because spo2(pulse ox) is not 100% correct. Spo2 is an estimate of oxygenation status. Readings below 90 on a pulse ox will not be accurate",
      "To answer your question directly, saturation of 90% is not considered dangerous and in fact it may be desirable.  Oxygen management of patients with COPD is complex and can be dangerous if left to inexperienced hands.  On one hand, oxygen supplementation has been shown to prolong life of the COPD patients.  On the other hand, too much oxygen may actually cause death via the mechanism described above.  The bottom line, discuss all changes of oxygenation rate with your friend's doctor and be clear on what changes are allowed. That is very important."

    "question": "Can you tell me what my eyeglasses prescription means?",
    "context": "I just had my eye examined and after four years of not going to the eye doctor thinking my vision was fine I was prescribed my first pair of glasses, I was told I am nearsighted and with my prescription I should have glasses on all the time. My prescription is RE -2.50 -0.50 110 LE -2.75 -0.50 090. How thick are my lenses going to be do you think, and how long should it take to get used to wearing glasses. I was told I can't wear contacts either.",
    "answers": [
      "The minus 2.50 is the degree of myopia or nearsightedness and means that your eyes are in focus between 1/2 and 1/3 meters from your nose. The -0.50 is a very small degree of astigmatism positioned at 90 and 110 degrees in the frame. This is not a strong prescription and the lenses will look normal and your eyes will not look distorted behind them. You should have very little difficulty adjusting, and you need not wear them for reading and other close work. I cannot comment on why you cannot wear contacts...you do not give enough information about yourself.",
      "I does't seem thick because mines is RE -425 sph; LE -400 -025 140 and mine are pretty thick but i have Featherwates so they make the lenses thinner. You'll get used to wearing them. It'll be okay.",
      "That's just going to be your average pair of glasses. I can't remember how long it took me to get used to glasses, but it wasn't too long."

    "question": "How often can I use a disposable razor blade?",
    "context": "I hate shaving, but I hate facial hairs even more! But buying razors can be expensive! So how often should I use one before I throw it away? Also, is there a way to keep a disposable sharp longer?   (And don't try to suggest pyramid power, please.)",
    "answers": [
      "One and done for disposables.  If you use it a second time, you run the risk of irritating those bumps you mentioned.  Have you tried an electric razor with a pre-shave conditioning powder?  Try it, most guys I knew from the Navy who had those bumps swore by it!  Good Luck!",
      "I find that most disposable razors will last for about a week's shaves.It really depends on the individual's facial hair. Coarse hair will dull a razor blade sooner than fine hair.",
      "it depends on the thickness of your hair. if your only shaving your face cause im assuming your a guy, it should last a week. but for females, we have legs, armpits, etc and i need a new razor ever two days or so.",
      "if youy use it this way ,it will last longest. 1.never use it without gel or foam,i prefer using clear hair shampoo with conditioner instead of foam.it gives great results. 2.let your fac be wet for 2 minutes prior to applying the foam. 3.never wipe the blade ,or touch its edge.wash it with warm runing water till its bright clean,then replace the cap. some times they last with me more than amounth till i am fed up with them.provided they are of good quality.",
      "I'D ONLY USE IT once . they are disposables so chuck it out use a fresh one each time you shave. face is more important than the legs . make sure noone else uses your razor if you don't throw it out . you don't know where it has been okie dokie."

    "context": "I can't remember the name of it.... I was adopted but I know my birth mother had something wrong \"down there\". There was recently a shot developed to help it; I can't remember the name though.  If you can figure out what the hell I'm talking about, can you answer these questions?: 1) I'm twelve years old so am I eligable for the shot? 2) Where is the shot given? 3) Is there any way I can be ABSOLUTELY sure that my birth-family had this in their history? I'm fairly sure but I don't want to be so worried.",

      "You must be talking about cervical cancer.This happens to many women even without a family history. When you become sexual active, you will need to see an ob/gyn on a regular basis.She will do an annual Pap Test.It doesn't hurt but is a but uncomfy.This is to test for cervical cancer. Now a new injection has come out to vaccinate girls your age against cervical cancer. Ask your parents to talk to your doctor about it and i am sure you can get it at your next appointment. What a great question.Taking care of your body is the best defense against illness.",
      "Are you asking about Cervical cancer? If so, it would be best for you to talk to your doctor. You can read up on it here: http://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm",
      "I think you are talking about cervical cancer, and the recent shots for HPV, Human Papillomavirus, which has been shown to cause many cases of cervical cancer. If this is what you are talking about, then yes, you are eligible for the shot. The federal government recently recommended the vaccinations for HPV for girls as young as 9. You can get the shot at your doctor's office. If he or she doesn't have it on hand, they can tell you who does. Alternately, you can ask your parent or guardian to take you to a gynecologist, who should be able to give you the shot. The link between HPV and cervical cancer has only been discovered recently, and it is estimated that most women will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. Even though you are not having sexual relations now (at least I hope not!) chances are good that you can get it later on. The vaccine is recommended for all women, not just women with a history of female reproductive cancers, so I don't know that you need to be absolutely sure about your birth-family history. I, too, am adopted, and I have had a hard time finding any medical information at all. What that means is that I have to be extra careful about things that tend to run in families, like breast cancer. I am 38, so I just try to be very vigilant about those kinds of things, and I have regular exams, mammograms, etc.  Right now, there is no need to be worried. Simply talk to your parent or guardian, and tell them you would like the shot. You don't have to show proof that it was a problem for your birth-mother, as they do them now as a preventative measure. I know what it's like to worry about things and not have a way to find out if they might be in your genetic makeup. It's very difficult to get medical information most of the time, so just take responsibility for your own health as you get older, and make sure you are screened for everything. If you want to contact me, you can do it through this site, and I will be happy to talk to you about this, as long as your parent or guardian agrees and does not mind. Be well."
