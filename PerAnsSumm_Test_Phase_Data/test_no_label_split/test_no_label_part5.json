      "Get a cold shower. Whatever you do don't cover up. When your body is putting off all that heat you will feel cold, the last thing you want to do is to keep it in. You really need to get your tempature down as soon as possible because being that high is a risk. Taking some tylenol can also help. The quickest way though is to take a cold shower. It's miserable but it'll help.",
      "It's called DOCTOR!!",
      "Take a couple aspirin, Tylenol or Advil. The advice about a warm bath is good as well, or put a damp rag in the freezer til it's frozen (it will be stiff, shake it out, or rinse it quickly under cold water) then put it on the back of your neck. Hope you feel better soon. You may have the flu. Your doctor can prescribe Tamiflu, but unless you have good prescription coverage, it is very expensive.",
      "Motren or Tylenol all ways works. Most doctors will not even see you unless your temp is at least 105 or more. You can also take a bath in room temp water. Not cold that could cause hypothermia. Do not take a cold shower. The reason your body's temp is going up is because It's trying to get rid of something. Hypothermia is real don't mess around with getting cold."

    "question": "pulmonary valve stenosis in my eight month old daughter.?",
    "context": "My eight month old daughter was just diagnosed with pulmonary valve stenosis.  Anyone have an experience with this?  Did you have cardiac catherization?  Did that fix the problem?",
    "answers": [
      "Treatment Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary valve stenosis, and few or no symptoms, do not require treatment. In more severe cases, the blocked valve will be opened surgically, either through balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valvulotomy. For initial treatment, balloon valvuloplasty is the procedure of choice. This is a catherization procedure in which a special catheter containing a deflated balloon is inserted in a blood vessel and threaded up into the heart. The catheter is positioned in the narrowed heart valve and the balloon is inflated to stretch the valve open. In some cases, surgical valvulotomy may be necessary. This is open heart surgery performed with a heart-lung machine. The valve is opened with an incision and in some cases, hypertrophied muscle in the right ventricle is removed. Rarely does the pulmonary valve need to be replaced. Alternative treatment Pulmonary valve stenosis can be life threatening and always requires a physician's care. In mild to moderate cases of pulmonary valve stenosis, general lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications, exercise, and stress reduction, can contribute to maintaining optimal wellness. Prognosis Patients with the most severe form of pulmonary valve stenosis may die in infancy. The prognosis for children with more severe stenosis who undergo balloon valvuloplasty or surgical valvulotomy is favorable. Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis can lead a normal life, but they require regular medical care. finally i wish the lil baby all health :)  if you have any specific question my e-mail drlioness2000@yahoo.com",
      "I was diagnosed with pulmonary valve stenosis at around the age of your daughter.  I am now 22 years old.  Around the time of my diagnosis the doctors did many tests and I had several cardiac catherizations.  The doctors found out from all of these tests that my pulmonic valve was so tight and was about to close (I had severe pulmonic stenosis; some is not severe therefore surgery would not be required probably).  The doctors performed open heart surgery when I was 3.  They totally removed my pulmonic valve.  This is the only valve that you can live without for a period of time.  The valve usually has to be put back at some point because without a valve there is some leakage to the right side of the heart.  For me, it will be within a year or so.  Some are much earlier when they have to have it replaced and some are later.  It all depends on the individual.  One huge recommendation is to go to a highly ranked hospital even for the tests.  Hope this helps!",
      "I don't know if it's the same but my son had aortic stenosis when he was born.  After many tests it just went away and no they did not have to do a catherization.  Never caused him any problems either.",
      "I had a different heart condition in high school. Mine was called superventricular tachicardia (SVT) but it required a cathedar in my heart. I had the ablasian surgery twice. We're not sure if it didnt work the first time or if there were two seperate problems, but after the second surgery I havent had any problems. Speak more to your doctor, he should be able to tell you more information and answer all of your questions. For me the surgery meant putting me to sleep and inserting the cathedar through three arteries, one on each side of my shoulders and one in the groin. I have very small scars that arent very noticable and I went home the next day."

    "question": "Any experience with heart failure?",
    "context": "My mom was just diagnosed with heart failure and I've looked on the net for info already.  I was wondering if anyone out there already has it and what your life has been like sense.  Any info would be helpful!",
    "answers": [
      "Hello, With optimal medication regimen and diet control (no more than 2 grams of salt a day), the symptoms of congestive heart failure (shortness of breath, leg swelling, inability to lie down without several pilloes) can be really well controlled.  Make sure your mom is under competent doctor care (either primary doctor or cardiologist). Good luck!",
      "Heart failure isn't good but depending on her circumstances: other medical problems, family history, smoking, weight, and age...she could have a great prognosis or a bad prognosis.  A great cardiologist is another important factor. You need to be able to communicate with the doctor. You should feel comfortable talking to him or her and you need to feel confident that your mom is being conscientiously taken care of. I grew up with my grandma and her 3 sisters. At some time or another, all of them were diagnosed with heart failure. Their lifestyles and the quality of care they received played a significant role in their longevity.  2 of my grandma's sisters ate poorly, they smoked, they were overweight and they, in general, didn't take good care of themselves. They didn't have as much success as my grandma and her remaining sister. Both of them were diagnosed with heart failure in their late 60's or early 70's and each of them lived to be in their mid-80's. They took care of themselves and if they were doing something that contributed to the problem, they stopped. I wish your mom the very best. It sounds like she has a wonderful daughter to take care of her. God Bless You. I'll say a prayer for you and your family.",
      "Heart failure has several basic etiologies.   1)  Ischemic - blockages in the arteries causing changes in the heart muscle. 2)  Valvular - leakage in one or two valves making the heart output inefficient.  There can also be leaks between the right side and the left side of the heart (called a shunt) that can affect the heart's efficiency too. 3)  Chemical toxicity - certain treatments, like chemo used to irradicate breast cancer can be toxic to the myocardium. 4) Post myocardial infarction - heart attack causes damage that may never fully heal.   5)  Idiopathic - No known other cause.  There's the genes and it usually is with people who have no other risk factors and it can happen at a young age.  Sometimes you hear about young athletes suddenly dying with this as a complicating issue. Treatments as discussed above can be very helpful. People can live very long lives with heart failure, but truly the prognosis depends on the etiology of the problem.  If the problem can be fixed or improved then the prognosis naturally improves.   Go along with your Mom (if she's okay with it) to her appointment and talk all of this over with her medical provider.  Good luck."
