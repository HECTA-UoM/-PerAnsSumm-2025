    "question": "How long does it take for wisdom teeth  to heal before you can eat normally?",
    "context": "Just got mine out and it hurts and is swollen.  And how long should the novacaine last?  Because my chin is still numb and it's very uncomfortable.",
    "answers": [
      "A long while. It took hours before the novocaine wore off when I had mine done. Once the novocaine does wear off, however, you should probably take some sort of painkiller, because --trust me-- it will hurt.  Also, I don't know if your dentist told you this, but you're usually not supposed to stick to soft, cold foods.  Hot, spicy and foods that require a lot of chewing often cause bleeding and pain. ;)",
      "The Novacaine will wear off in a couple of hours,  the pain -in a couple of days... Try not to eat anything too solid or crunchy tomorrow... -& go easy eating on Thanksgiving. Otherwise, you should be pain free by Monday.",
      "I didn't eat regular food for a week. But I was able to make do with yogurt and ice cream and such. Also, make sure you use your saltwater rinse, it helps it heal. Good luck!! I hated having mine out",
      "It's different for everyone, hun.  I was able to eat again that same day and had virtually no pain at all once the surgery was over. Then again, though, I was in so much pain BEFORE the surgery (I had six impacted and infected wisdom teeth) that any pain I felt AFTER the surgery was so mild that it was close to obsolete. Your oral surgeon gave you some strong stuff to numb that area.  It may not completely wear off for 24 hours, depending on how well your body take to the drugs that he gave you.  If you're in pain, though, I recommend trying 600 mg of ibuprofen.  It's a great anti-inflammatory, and as long as you eat some pudding, mashed potatoes, or cream of wheat before you take it, it shouldn't irritate your stomach. Don't chew anything until the numbness is gone.  You could bite a hole in your cheek or your tongue.",
      "I hate the numb chin and tongue thing!!! I didn't eat regular food for at least a week. I was numb that whole night...it wasn't until late at night that it started to wear off."

    "question": "Milk Teeth Grooming problem in Kids?",
    "context": "My 7 yrs old daughter's front 2 milk teeth has fallen down 6 month before. Why they did't new teeth born as yet. She ate averagely",
    "answers": [
      "Her teeth will grow in eventually.  Meanwhile try not to tell her that she looks ugly with the big hole in her head.  Many kids her age have a similar from ages 6-8,",
      "What did her dentist say?  6 months ago? She should have told you something.  Are you a Holistic parent?  You daughter should be under a dentist care since  shortly after her first tooth!  Why are you asking us.  Maybe she has anodontia a rare condition where you are born with out one or more teeth.  Take her to a dentist, so you wont worry about her dental future.  Those baby teeth do more than just help with MILK.  The hold the spaced, provide a stable occlusion to stimulate jaw growth, and hole the bone open for the erupting permanent teeth.  She could have many subgingival caivities that you are unaware of.   Take her in.",
      "I know the same feeling.I have a tooth like that it fell out more than 6 months ago and is less than half way grown in yet. I was also worried butthere is no need to worry. It is just taking its time coming in. If you are still worried you can go to a doctor. Possibly your daughter was born without a replacment tooth. But not to worry. If she seems sad just tell her that her teeth went on a long vacation but they couldn't take her with them. Wish you and your child the best."

So please consult a specialist doctor at least every 3 months and a dentist every year. Sugar, fat & oils (fried foods) should be avoided. You may also take the following tests:- (1) Fasting blood sugar and post prandial blood sugar.  (2) HbA1c (3) Lipid profile. (4) Urine routine analysis. Please see the webpages for more details on Diabetes.",

    "question": "what is the safe range of glucose random/fasting?",
    "context": "In november 2005 i got my glucose fasting checked, it came to 129.Since i have a family history of diabetes, my doctor advised me to start Metformin rightaway, so i'm taking Metformin (glucophage) 500mg three times a day with each meal, since six months, i lost weight from 83kgs to 71kgs. i'm 48yrs. my glucose fasting now stays between 87-104.Now I feel a lot better ever since i lost weight. Shall i continue with the same dosage or need to reduce dosage. I've controlled my diet and has been using tread-mill though not so regularly. My doctor told me that i should try to gradually bring down my weight to 68kgs..  Knowing that metformin has helped me a lot in weight reduction, my wife started taking that too, although she has normal glucose level...is that ok? since we have heard some people take it to lose weight?",
    "answers": [
      "74-105 is the average \"normal\" range. But if your glucose was 158 fasting, it's a bit high, but not so high as to panic.  Talk with your doctor, see a specialist and find out as much as you can about your disease. Diabetes is best treated and maintained with education and vigilance.  Good for you that you lost weight! Some diabetics find loosing weight very hard.  Stay active, eat healthy and keep your charbs down.  Get as much info as possible and see your doctor regularly for checkups and diabetes maintainence!",
      "You should continue with the same dosage unless your doctor says different. As for your wife, if she has normal glucose level, she should NOT be taking it.",
      "I have had diabetes for 30 years and you know what, unless somebody with an md meaning doctor answers your question, I would not trust them. Nor wouuld I make any lifechanging decisions based on their answers. For example if you are in Europe, I believe the numbers used to judge good and bad blood sugar levels are different scale than those in US. I could be wrong ut it possible for your 129 to equal a 200 here. With all medical questions here, ask a doctor."

    "question": "I'm looking for the Diabetic Lowcarb Diet plan. Anyone know about it?",
    "context": "My dr. suggested I use the Diabetic LowCarb Diet, but I can't find any other information about it.  Does anyone know about this diet and where to find it?  Thanks.",
    "answers": [
      "I would first recommend you check with a dietitian, many times your insurance will pay for this since its cheaper than an amputation for mismanaged  diabetes. You are going to need a diet specific to your needs and a dietitian is your best bet to maintain a healthy weight and a healthy blood sugar level. Many larger hospitals and Medical Centers have diabetes clinics to help you find a diet that works for you. If you can not find any resources in your area try The Carbohydrate Addicts Diet by Dr's Rachel and Richard Heller. There is usually a copy at the local library or you can do a search on goggle for the diet and get tips and buy the book directly from them. Its a good low carb diet that still allows carbs every day so you are not craving anything.",
      "The best NATURAL answer to Diabetes is Bitter Melon. This vegetable is available in all Philipino markets. I think some Indian grocery shops also have this vegetable. Wash the vegetable and eat it raw - about half the vegetable per day and check your sugar level after about 4 days - you will see the difference. Of course I must warn you that the taste of it is very unpleasant. Once you know that it is good for you you will come to like it. I know a person who was injecting insulin daily stopped it after his wife started to crush the vegetable and made him to drink a half cup of this juice daily. Of course you have to have it raw. Boiling it or cooking it and eating it will have no results. So I am not sure how well your dad will enjot it. If you get good results post it as a question in this section so that others will know the value of this vegetable.",
      "See a dietician.  Make sure you eat at least 50 grams of carbs. per day to prevent muscle wasting.  Don't eat processed foods, eat lots of fruit and fresh veggies."
