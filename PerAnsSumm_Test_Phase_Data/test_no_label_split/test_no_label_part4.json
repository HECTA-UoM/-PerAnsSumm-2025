      "It depends on which supplements you're using to determine the side effects.  Generally, they're pretty safe to use, although the best way to get nutrition in terms of body building is to eat natural protein.  Just be careful to follow directions on the supplements and not overdose.  Also, if your muscles get to big for your bodyframe, you will risk injuring your tendons and ligaments since they also need to adapt to growing muscles.",
      "Some may cause electrolyte disorder resulting in liver problems, fainting spells to name a few side-effects, which later may be irreversible. First get a complete medical checkup (blood work, etc..)This will tell you what your body is lacking in nutrition. A normal diet daily is the best supplement there is. Read up on supplements and don't believe the hype.",
      "Depends on what kind of supplements you're reffering to. You should avoid steriods and try to stay with natural supplements."

    "question": "Should I work out?",
    "context": "Im a very skinny 14 year old 5'4'' and 112 pounds. If so should i start slow cuz im weak?",
    "answers": [
      "I think you should try to swim... It makes you hungry and you can eat a cow after you have swim for an hour! It also create least damage to your joints....",
      "Do you want to to work out?  If so, yes, you should start slow and work up to what ever you decide to do whether it walking or lifting weights.  Exercise is good for the body and mind.",
      "if you've never worked out before, yes, you should take it easy at first. Learn the proper form so you can avoid injury and ensure you are working the muscles correctly.  When you first start, your muscles are going to be very sore because you are subjecting them to a workload they aren't used to. Give yourself enough time to recover before you work out again. If the muscles haven't had a chance to rebuild and you work them hard again, you won't be gaining anything, plus you run the risk of an overtraining injury. After a few workouts, your muscles will become stronger and \"used\" to the new burdens you are putting through, so the soreness won't be as bad, or take as long to recover from."

    "question": "A question for weight lifters/body builders?",
    "context": "Is anyone familiar with the pyramid system of weight training? Where you work a particular area (ie: biceps) with three different weight dumbells. Starting w/ the lightest weight, then mid, then heaviest....then back down the pyramid. (A set of 12 reps each.)  Is there any advantage or disadvantage to this method for sculpting, as compared to three sets of 12 reps with the same pound dumbells?",
    "answers": [
      "Your pyramid training protocol is effective. Someone else posted a different one and that is good too. In fact I know of several other types of pyramids that are also good. If you want definition you need to cut fat though. Try high intensity interval training. It should let you cut fat without any muscle loss. In fact you can still build. Keep in mind you should always change your training protocol every so often. For example you could cycle between pyramids, max-ot and German volume training. You would get nice results from that. In addition, here is my favorite pyramid protocol. I do the same number of reps. I start with 2 or 3 warm up sets getting heavier. Then I do my heavy set where I max out and go to failure at my chosen rep range. Then I lower the weight a little on each aditional set. The advantage is you can max out heavy when you are fresh and continue to get more sets in with less rest.",
      "Actually you should do 3 sets 12,10,8 or 10,8,6 reps starting with a weight that gives you enough resistance, then try to increase the weight from 3 to 5 pounds each hand each set. This method is one of 2 methods used in weight training. This one method is good for muscle fatigue training and is best also for sculpting your body, the other method would be to increase your muscle strength and does not sculpt your body as well but will actually increase your over all strength. Using the heaviest weight for 3 sets of 12 reps. I suggest you to get barbells over dumbbells (difference is that with barbells you can change the weight plates while dumbbells are fixed weights,and as there name suggest you cannot change there weight) they are a better investment. Hope this helped",
      "That is a very old system that bodybuilders still use today.  The key to building muscle is to break it down and then give it time to rebuild.  It really helps to change up your routine so your body doesn't get \"used to\" a particular way of working out.  This way, you will continue to make gains.  Stay away from drugs and fads.  There are always consequences that aren't worth it.",
      "There is always an advantage when you exercise you muscles, if you feel the tention you are straining then you are gaining. Yes it is better to start out light then add a little more til you reach your peak. Then take a little off at the end of your workout if it feels to heavy you don't want to pull something by over working your mucsles. Start out low to losen up add more til you can do no more then lighten the load so you can finish your workout.",
      "it's mainly trial or error, that's all u can do. I'd say what's also important is ur diet is up to scratch too. Which means u have at least a gram of protien per lbs of bodyweight spaced out into 5 to 7 meals a day. Michael"

    "question": "Please help me with my back problems!?",
    "context": "A year and a half ago I injured my back badly playing basketball.  My bottom vertabrae actually moved a little to the side, a few millimeters.  I started going to the chiropractor and they took x-rays.  It turns out my spine also has a pretty bad S curve, so I have scoliosis.  I am a college student w/out any health insurance, so I can't even go to the doctor let alone an expensive chiropractor.  My chiropractor said he would give me exercises to strengthen my lower back and other ones to help my scoliosis, but he kept saying next time and I eventually stopped going.  Can anyone refer me to a website or help me with how I can help my back.  Thanks.  (sorry this is so long)",
    "answers": [
      "About your lower back problems I can tell you this:    WORK YOUR STOMACH OUT. DO SIT-UPS REGULARLY.  STRONG ABDOMEN = NO BACK PAIN  Plain and simple.",
      "Get in touch with me I can get you in contact with the write person in your area if you tell me where you live.( don't be sorry without proper communication there is no understanding, so if I am not willing to listen I dont know how to help) have a great day !",
      "My advice: 1.   At night, sleep on your side, legs slightly bent, with a thin pillow between your knees.  This will reduce the presure on your spine as you sleep. 2.  Stretch your back several times a day.  A good one is lay flat on your back, rotate your trunk, with your left leg straight and your right leg bent, try to touch your right knee to the ground to your left. Then straighten your right leg, bend your left leg, rotate your trunk, try to touch your left knee to the ground to your right.  Another good one is when sitting, reach your right hand behind your head, and touch your left shoulder blade, then reach your left hand behind your head and try to touch your right should blade. 3.  If your a student, you should have access to the campus health club.  Join, and ask to be shown stretches and exercises specifically for your back (explain that you've had some back issues)."

    "question": "Why do my shins hurt when I jog?",
    "context": "I am 24 years old, male, quit smoking over a month ago, and have decided to start exercising because I am about 20/25 pounds heavier then I'd like to be.  This evening was my first physical exercise other then casual walking in about 2 years.  Right away when I was jogging my shins began to hurt.  Why is this?  Is it my shoes, my weight?  or just my lack of exercise? and What can I do to reduce and/or be rid of this pain?",
    "answers": [
      "It could be a combination of all the things you mention.  Pain in the shins while exercising, commonly referred to as shin splints, is a condition where there is pain in the anterior tibia caused by overuse of the anterior tibilias muscle. They are most common in inexperienced runners or runners who overtrain. The pain is usually worsened by exertion and other factors: - Running on hard surfaces - Insufficient padding in the shoes  - Over-pronated and/or flat feet can also lead to increased stress on the lower leg muscles during exercise - High arched feet can experience shin splint discomfort because this foot type is a poor shock absorber. The treatment for shin splints is rest. Running and other strenuous lower limb activities should be avoided until the pain subsides and is no longer elicited by activity. In conjunction with rest, icing and anti-inflammatories may be suggested by a doctor or trainer, though there is some controversy over their effectiveness. A contributing cause of shin splints in some cases is the relative weakness of the muscles on the anterior of the lower leg compared to those in the calf. In this case exercises that preferentially strengthen the anterior muscles may help alleviate or avoid shin splints. If you are just starting to run.  Take it easy and progress into a walking program first before running.

      "You have shin splints.  They can be painful but easily remedies.  Simply put, you need new shoes.  Specifically, running shoes.",
      "i had shin splints and that is what you shound like after a while the pain went away when my bones finaly got used to the stress of exercise. the pain was worth it but is sucked. You can always talk to a bone dr just to make sure. have fun;;",
      "well i think ur over weight... and u need to exercise more... do exercise buh dunt over do it.. jus exercise a lil everyday and everyday u add 5 minz more to ur exercises.. dunt push urself to do more than ur body can handle... bcuz ur gonna have health problems later on... and i dunt think u wanna have any so jus becareful!!",
      "It is your body saying \"STOP IT\" it is my firm belief that jogging is bad for the feet, ankles, knees, hip joints, and reproductive organs too. At least that's what I tell my wife........I think fast walking is the best."
