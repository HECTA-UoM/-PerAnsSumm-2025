      "INFORMATION": [
        "I actually just learned about this in Biology class. If you are a male with color blindness, and and you wife doesn't have any family history of it, then if you have a girl there is no chance of it, but if you have a boy there is a 50/50 chance. If you are a female and have color blindness, and your husband has no family history of the disease then it's like a 2/3 chance for the boy and still no chance for the girl, but if both of you have a family history for the disease then a girl could get it. This is because a boy only has one X sex chromsome so if they got the recessive trait of colorblindness on that X chromosome then they wouldn't be able to get a dominant gene, unlike females who have two X sex chromosomes, and thus have a bettter chance of recieving a dominant gene to mask the color blindness recessive gene.",
        "Color blindness is transmitted by female parent and the male child suffers.Female child can transmit(not suffer)to her son.It is a sex linked disease.Rare exceptions occur if mother is a carrier and father is a patient.",
        "Colorblindness is a sex-linked trait. That means it affects men more then woman because it attaches to the X chromosome. Since woman have two X chromosomes (XX) they need both of their genes to carry the gene in order to have colorblindness. For a man, his genes are XY, and since he only has one X, it only takes one X carrier to make him colorblind. Woman can also be carriers of colorblindness.",
        "Mother colorblind + Father normal = Boy 100% on colorblindness + Girl 100% carrier Mother + Father colorblind = Boy + Girl 100% on colorblindness Mother carrier + Father colorblind = Boy 50% on colorblindness + girl 50% carrier Mother + Father normal = 0% on colorblindness for girl + boy Mother normal + Father colorblind = Boy normal + girl 100% carrier Mother + Father colorblind = both girl + boy 100% on colorblindness"
