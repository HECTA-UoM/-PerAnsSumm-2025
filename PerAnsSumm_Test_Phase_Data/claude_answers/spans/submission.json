If you are a female and have color blindness, and your husband has no family history of the disease then it's like a 2/3 chance for the boy and still no chance for the girl, but if both of you have a family history for the disease then a girl could get it. This is because a boy only has one X sex chromsome so if they got the recessive trait of colorblindness on that X chromosome then they wouldn't be able to get a dominant gene, unlike females who have two X sex chromosomes, and thus have a bettter chance of recieving a dominant gene to mask the color blindness recessive gene.",
