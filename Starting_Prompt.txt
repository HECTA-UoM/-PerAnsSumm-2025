Could you write me a prompt that takes a test set answer and provides the format that is expected in the output, could you look very carefully at how the spans are structured and what the labels are/what they represent in this specific database and be able to detect spans and create reasonable spans and summarization. Make sure to look very closely at the data I have provided and come up with a good prompt that captures the essence of each label and how to pick it up accordingly, this prompt will be used for another model with no previous knowledge about the task so you will need to make sure you explain it all thoroughly

[Provided a snapshot of the data here maybe 5 - 8 examples]

Before completing the task, just talk out loud about the task and how you will complete it, and ask me any questions you may have before writing this prompt, this prompt will just be the first version, I will give you more examples so you are able to refine it more and I will test it with the model and bring back the results so you can tweak the prompt to see better behaviour, I will give you the original input with the prompt you will create, then give you the model output along with the ground truth so you are able to tweak it
